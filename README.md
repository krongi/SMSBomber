App that allows you to repeatedly send text messages to a target number.

This android app was created using the tasker app for android.

I had a desire to repeatedly send a message to a friend of mine. Unfortunately the Play store has no such apps available. Of course. Why would they? So the only logical
conclusion I came to was to create my own. Tasker made this incredibly easy to do (but also incredibly cumbersome and aggravating due to the way it had to be setup). The 
version name was a joke to make Larry Framer uncomfortable. Boy did it work.

It will only work on android phones. I don't recall if you need to be rooted or not, but it wouldn't hurt anyway.

App allows you to specify a target phone number, message to be sent, number of times to send the message and the delay between messages.

Readme needs updating after I run the app again and ensure it's the way I remember. Also some improvements may be on the way. We'll see if I got time
